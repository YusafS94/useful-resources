# useful-resources
Hand picked list of useful resources. This is just a personal project to help reduce bookmark fatigue.

Resources include things like generators, tutorials, frameworks, challenge websites, and developer community sites. Just for myself as a little project to help organise my websites, as i am currently drowning in bookmarks.
